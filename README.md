## 📊 Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on analyzing student academic data and building a machine learning model to predict student performance. The goal is to understand how various factors affect academic outcomes and to use data-driven insights for prediction.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Educational institutions often struggle to identify students who may underperform academically. By analyzing historical student data, we can predict performance in advance and help institutions take preventive or supportive actions.

---

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset contains student-related attributes such as:

* Gender
* Parental level of education
* Test preparation course
* Scores in math, reading, and writing

The dataset is used to explore patterns and relationships affecting student performance.

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During EDA, the following steps were performed:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Handling missing and categorical values
* Univariate and multivariate analysis
* Visualization of score distributions and relationships

EDA helped identify key factors influencing student performance.

---

## ⚙️ Model Building

Machine learning models were trained to predict student performance using the processed dataset.

### Models Used:

* Linear Regression
* Decision Tree Regressor
* Random Forest Regressor

The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated using appropriate regression metrics such as:

* R² Score
* Mean Squared Error (if applicable)

The best-performing model was selected based on evaluation results.

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib & Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
